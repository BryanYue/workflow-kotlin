/**
 * Represents a [Workflow]'s "identity" and is used by the runtime to determine whether a workflow
 * is the same as a workflow as was rendered in a previous render pass, in which case its state
 * should be re-used, or if it's a new workflow and needs to be started.
 *
 * The identity consists primarily of the workflow's concrete type (i.e. the class that implements
 * the [Workflow] interface). Two workflows of the same concrete type are considered identical.
 *
 * However, if a workflow class implements [ImpostorWorkflow], the identifier will also include
 * that workflow's [ImpostorWorkflow.realIdentifier].
 *
 * @constructor
 * The workflow's type must be passed _either_ as a [KClass] or a string, but only one must be
 * non-null. The [KClass] should be passed in if it's available, to avoid reflection calls upfront,
 * but the class's name may be passed instead if the [KClass] is not available, eg. when restoring
 * this class from its serialized form.
 *
 * The workflow type must be final, since a non-final class or interface means two different
 * workflow types could be considered identical.
 *
 * @param type The [KClass] of the [Workflow] this identifier identifies.
 * @param typeString The fully-qualified name of the [KClass] of the workflow this identifier
 * identifies.
 * @param proxiedIdentifier An optional identifier from [ImpostorWorkflow.realIdentifier] that will
 * be used to further narrow the scope of this identifier.
